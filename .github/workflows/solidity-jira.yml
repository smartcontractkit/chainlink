# This is its own independent workflow since "solidity.yml" depends on "merge_group" and "push" events.
# But for ensuring that JIRA tickets are always updated, we only care about "pull_request" events.
#
# We still need to add "merge_group" event and noop so that we'll pass required workflow checks.
#
# I didn't add this to the "changeset.yml" workflow because the "changeset" job isnt required, and we'd need to add the "merge_group" event to the "changeset.yml" workflow.
# If we made the change to make it required.
