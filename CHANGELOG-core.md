## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

New cron strings MUST now include time zone. If you want your jobs to run in UTC for example: `CRON_TZ=UTC * * * * *`. Previously, jobs specified without a time zone would run in the server's native time zone, which in most cases is UTC but this was never guaranteed.
