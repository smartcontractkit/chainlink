   * @notice Request a set of random words.
   * @param keyHash - Corresponds to a particular oracle job which uses
   * that key for generating the VRF proof. Different keyHash's have different gas price
   * ceilings, so you can select a specific one to bound your maximum per request cost.
   * @param subId  - The ID of the VRF subscription. Must be funded
   * with the minimum subscription balance required for the selected keyHash.
   * @param minimumRequestConfirmations - How many blocks you'd like the
   * oracle to wait before responding to the request. See SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
   * for why you may want to request more. The acceptable range is
   * [minimumRequestBlockConfirmations, 200].
   * @param callbackGasLimit - How much gas you'd like to receive in your
   * fulfillRandomWords callback. Note that gasleft() inside fulfillRandomWords
   * may be slightly less than this amount because of gas used calling the function
   * (argument decoding etc.), so you may need to request slightly more than you expect
   * to have inside fulfillRandomWords. The acceptable range is
   * [0, maxGasLimit]
   * @param numWords - The number of uint256 random values you'd like to receive
   * in your fulfillRandomWords callback. Note these numbers are expanded in a
   * secure way by the VRFCoordinator from a single random value supplied by the oracle.
   * @param nativePayment - Whether payment should be made in ETH or LINK.
   * @return requestId - A unique identifier of the request. Can be used to match
   * a request to a response in fulfillRandomWords.
