Given two reports generated by Slither - a Solidity static analysis tool - provided at the bottom of the reply, your task is to help create a report for your peers with new issues introduced in the second report in order to decrease noise resulting from irrelevant changes to the report, by focusing on a single topic: **New Issues**.

First report is provided under Heading 2 (##) called `report1` and is surrounded by triple backticks (```) to indicate the beginning and end of the report.
Second report is provided under Heading 2 (##) called `report2` and is surrounded by triple backticks (```) to indicate the beginning and end of the report.

First report is report generated by Slither using default branch of the code repository. Second report is report generated by Slither using a feature branch of the code repository. You want to help your peers understand the impact of changes they introduced in the pull request on the codebase and whether they introduced any new issues.

**New Issues**

Provide a bullet point summary of new issues that were introduced in the second report. If a given issue is not present in first report, but is present in the second one, it is considered a new issue. If the count for given issue type is higher in the second report than in the first one, it is considered a new issue.
For each issue include original description text from the report together with severity level, issue ID, line number and a link to problematic line in the code.
Group the issues by their type, which is defined as Heading 2 (##).

Output your response starting from**New Issues** in escaped, markdown text that can be sent as http body to API. Do not wrap output in code blocks.
Extract the name of the file from the first line of the report and title the new report with it in a following way: "# Slither's new issues in: <file_name>"

Remember that it might be possible that second report does not introduce any new issues. In such case, provide an empty report.

Format **New Issues** as Heading 2 using double sharp characters (##). Otherwise, do not include any another preamble and postamble to your answer.
