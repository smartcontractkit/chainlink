// A Batch is a sequence of Sets, Merges, Deletes, DeleteRanges, RangeKeySets,
// RangeKeyUnsets, and/or RangeKeyDeletes that are applied atomically. Batch
// implements the Reader interface, but only an indexed batch supports reading
// (without error) via Get or NewIter. A non-indexed batch will return
// ErrNotIndexed when read from. A batch is not safe for concurrent use, and
// consumers should use a batch per goroutine or provide their own
// synchronization.
//
// # Indexing
//
// Batches can be optionally indexed (see DB.NewIndexedBatch). An indexed batch
// allows iteration via an Iterator (see Batch.NewIter). The iterator provides
// a merged view of the operations in the batch and the underlying
// database. This is implemented by treating the batch as an additional layer
// in the LSM where every entry in the batch is considered newer than any entry
// in the underlying database (batch entries have the InternalKeySeqNumBatch
// bit set). By treating the batch as an additional layer in the LSM, iteration
// supports all batch operations (i.e. Set, Merge, Delete, DeleteRange,
// RangeKeySet, RangeKeyUnset, RangeKeyDelete) with minimal effort.
//
// The same key can be operated on multiple times in a batch, though only the
// latest operation will be visible. For example, Put("a", "b"), Delete("a")
// will cause the key "a" to not be visible in the batch. Put("a", "b"),
// Put("a", "c") will cause a read of "a" to return the value "c".
//
// The batch index is implemented via an skiplist (internal/batchskl). While
// the skiplist implementation is very fast, inserting into an indexed batch is
// significantly slower than inserting into a non-indexed batch. Only use an
// indexed batch if you require reading from it.
//
// # Atomic commit
//
// The operations in a batch are persisted by calling Batch.Commit which is
// equivalent to calling DB.Apply(batch). A batch is committed atomically by
// writing the internal batch representation to the WAL, adding all of the
// batch operations to the memtable associated with the WAL, and then
// incrementing the visible sequence number so that subsequent reads can see
// the effects of the batch operations. If WriteOptions.Sync is true, a call to
// Batch.Commit will guarantee that the batch is persisted to disk before
// returning. See commitPipeline for more on the implementation details.
//
// # Large batches
//
// The size of a batch is limited only by available memory (be aware that
// indexed batches require considerably additional memory for the skiplist
// structure). A given WAL file has a single memtable associated with it (this
// restriction could be removed, but doing so is onerous and complex). And a
// memtable has a fixed size due to the underlying fixed size arena. Note that
// this differs from RocksDB where a memtable can grow arbitrarily large using
// a list of arena chunks. In RocksDB this is accomplished by storing pointers
// in the arena memory, but that isn't possible in Go.
//
// During Batch.Commit, a batch which is larger than a threshold (>
// MemTableSize/2) is wrapped in a flushableBatch and inserted into the queue
// of memtables. A flushableBatch forces WAL to be rotated, but that happens
// anyways when the memtable becomes full so this does not cause significant
// WAL churn. Because the flushableBatch is readable as another layer in the
// LSM, Batch.Commit returns as soon as the flushableBatch has been added to
// the queue of memtables.
//
// Internally, a flushableBatch provides Iterator support by sorting the batch
// contents (the batch is sorted once, when it is added to the memtable
// queue). Sorting the batch contents and insertion of the contents into a
// memtable have the same big-O time, but the constant factor dominates
// here. Sorting is significantly faster and uses significantly less memory.
//
// # Internal representation
//
// The internal batch representation is a contiguous byte buffer with a fixed
// 12-byte header, followed by a series of records.
//
//	+-------------+------------+--- ... ---+
//	| SeqNum (8B) | Count (4B) |  Entries  |
//	+-------------+------------+--- ... ---+
//
// Each record has a 1-byte kind tag prefix, followed by 1 or 2 length prefixed
// strings (varstring):
//
//	+-----------+-----------------+-------------------+
//	| Kind (1B) | Key (varstring) | Value (varstring) |
//	+-----------+-----------------+-------------------+
//
// A varstring is a varint32 followed by N bytes of data. The Kind tags are
// exactly those specified by InternalKeyKind. The following table shows the
// format for records of each kind:
//
//	InternalKeyKindDelete         varstring
//	InternalKeyKindLogData        varstring
//	InternalKeyKindIngestSST      varstring
//	InternalKeyKindSet            varstring varstring
//	InternalKeyKindMerge          varstring varstring
//	InternalKeyKindRangeDelete    varstring varstring
//	InternalKeyKindRangeKeySet    varstring varstring
//	InternalKeyKindRangeKeyUnset  varstring varstring
//	InternalKeyKindRangeKeyDelete varstring varstring
//
// The intuitive understanding here are that the arguments to Delete, Set,
// Merge, DeleteRange and RangeKeyDelete are encoded into the batch. The
// RangeKeySet and RangeKeyUnset operations are slightly more complicated,
// encoding their end key, suffix and value [in the case of RangeKeySet] within
// the Value varstring. For more information on the value encoding for
// RangeKeySet and RangeKeyUnset, see the internal/rangekey package.
//
// The internal batch representation is the on disk format for a batch in the
// WAL, and thus stable. New record kinds may be added, but the existing ones
// will not be modified.
