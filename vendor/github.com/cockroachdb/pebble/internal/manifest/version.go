//   - Smallest and Largest (and their counterparts
//     {Smallest, Largest}{Point,Range}Key) remain tight bounds that represent a
//     key at that exact bound. We make the effort to determine the next smallest
//     or largest key in an sstable after virtualizing it, to maintain this
//     tightness. If the largest is a sentinel key (IsExclusiveSentinel()), it
//     could mean that a rangedel or range key ends at that user key, or has been
//     truncated to that user key.
//   - One invariant is that if a rangedel or range key is truncated on its
//     upper bound, the virtual sstable *must* have a rangedel or range key
//     sentinel key as its upper bound. This is because truncation yields
//     an exclusive upper bound for the rangedel/rangekey, and if there are
//     any points at that exclusive upper bound within the same virtual
//     sstable, those could get uncovered by this truncation. We enforce this
//     invariant in calls to keyspan.Truncate.
//   - Size is an estimate of the size of the virtualized portion of this sstable.
//     The underlying file's size is stored in FileBacking.Size, though it could
//     also be estimated or could correspond to just the referenced portion of
//     a file (eg. if the file originated on another node).
//   - Size must be > 0.
//   - SmallestSeqNum and LargestSeqNum are loose bounds for virtual sstables.
//     This means that all keys in the virtual sstable must have seqnums within
//     [SmallestSeqNum, LargestSeqNum], however there's no guarantee that there's
//     a key with a seqnum at either of the bounds. Calculating tight seqnum

		// We have 2 kinds of files:
		// - Files with exactly one sequence number: these could be either ingested files
		//   or flushed files. We cannot tell the difference between them based on FileMetadata,
		//   so our consistency checking here uses the weaker checks assuming it is a narrow
		//   flushed file. We cannot error on ingested files having sequence numbers coincident
		//   with flushed files as the seemingly ingested file could just be a flushed file
		//   with just one key in it which is a truncated range tombstone sharing sequence numbers
		//   with other files in the same flush.
		// - Files with multiple sequence numbers: these are necessarily flushed files.
		//
		// Three cases of overlapping sequence numbers:
		// Case 1:
		// An ingested file contained in the sequence numbers of the flushed file -- it must be
		// fully contained (not coincident with either end of the flushed file) since the memtable
		// must have been at [a, b-1] (where b > a) when the ingested file was assigned sequence
		// num b, and the memtable got a subsequent update that was given sequence num b+1, before
		// being flushed.
		//
		// So a sequence [1000, 1000] [1002, 1002] [1000, 2000] is invalid since the first and
		// third file are inconsistent with each other. So comparing adjacent files is insufficient
		// for consistency checking.
		//
		// Visually we have something like
		// x------y x-----------yx-------------y (flushed files where x, y are the endpoints)
		//     y       y  y        y             (y's represent ingested files)
		// And these are ordered in increasing order of y. Note that y's must be unique.
		//
		// Case 2:
		// A flushed file that did not overlap in keys with any file in any level, but does overlap
		// in the file key intervals. This file is placed in L0 since it overlaps in the file
		// key intervals but since it has no overlapping data, it is assigned a sequence number
		// of 0 in RocksDB. We handle this case for compatibility with RocksDB.
		//
		// Case 3:
		// A sequence of flushed files that overlap in sequence numbers with one another,
		// but do not overlap in keys inside the sstables. These files correspond to
		// partitioned flushes or the results of intra-L0 compactions of partitioned
		// flushes.
		//
		// Since these types of SSTables violate most other sequence number
		// overlap invariants, and handling this case is important for compatibility
		// with future versions of pebble, this method relaxes most L0 invariant
		// checks.
