// compactionIter provides a forward-only iterator that encapsulates the logic
// for collapsing entries during compaction. It wraps an internal iterator and
// collapses entries that are no longer necessary because they are shadowed by
// newer entries. The simplest example of this is when the internal iterator
// contains two keys: a.PUT.2 and a.PUT.1. Instead of returning both entries,
// compactionIter collapses the second entry because it is no longer
// necessary. The high-level structure for compactionIter is to iterate over
// its internal iterator and output 1 entry for every user-key. There are four
// complications to this story.
//
// 1. Eliding Deletion Tombstones
//
// Consider the entries a.DEL.2 and a.PUT.1. These entries collapse to
// a.DEL.2. Do we have to output the entry a.DEL.2? Only if a.DEL.2 possibly
// shadows an entry at a lower level. If we're compacting to the base-level in
// the LSM tree then a.DEL.2 is definitely not shadowing an entry at a lower
// level and can be elided.
//
// We can do slightly better than only eliding deletion tombstones at the base
// level by observing that we can elide a deletion tombstone if there are no
// sstables that contain the entry's key. This check is performed by
// elideTombstone.
//
// 2. Merges
//
// The MERGE operation merges the value for an entry with the existing value
// for an entry. The logical value of an entry can be composed of a series of
// merge operations. When compactionIter sees a MERGE, it scans forward in its
// internal iterator collapsing MERGE operations for the same key until it
// encounters a SET or DELETE operation. For example, the keys a.MERGE.4,
// a.MERGE.3, a.MERGE.2 will be collapsed to a.MERGE.4 and the values will be
// merged using the specified Merger.
//
// An interesting case here occurs when MERGE is combined with SET. Consider
// the entries a.MERGE.3 and a.SET.2. The collapsed key will be a.SET.3. The
// reason that the kind is changed to SET is because the SET operation acts as
// a barrier preventing further merging. This can be seen better in the
// scenario a.MERGE.3, a.SET.2, a.MERGE.1. The entry a.MERGE.1 may be at lower
// (older) level and not involved in the compaction. If the compaction of
// a.MERGE.3 and a.SET.2 produced a.MERGE.3, a subsequent compaction with
// a.MERGE.1 would merge the values together incorrectly.
//
// 3. Snapshots
//
// Snapshots are lightweight point-in-time views of the DB state. At its core,
// a snapshot is a sequence number along with a guarantee from Pebble that it
// will maintain the view of the database at that sequence number. Part of this
// guarantee is relatively straightforward to achieve. When reading from the
// database Pebble will ignore sequence numbers that are larger than the
// snapshot sequence number. The primary complexity with snapshots occurs
// during compaction: the collapsing of entries that are shadowed by newer
// entries is at odds with the guarantee that Pebble will maintain the view of
// the database at the snapshot sequence number. Rather than collapsing entries
// up to the next user key, compactionIter can only collapse entries up to the
// next snapshot boundary. That is, every snapshot boundary potentially causes
// another entry for the same user-key to be emitted. Another way to view this
// is that snapshots define stripes and entries are collapsed within stripes,
// but not across stripes. Consider the following scenario:
//
//	a.PUT.9
//	a.DEL.8
//	a.PUT.7
//	a.DEL.6
//	a.PUT.5
//
// In the absence of snapshots these entries would be collapsed to
// a.PUT.9. What if there is a snapshot at sequence number 7? The entries can
// be divided into two stripes and collapsed within the stripes:
//
//	a.PUT.9        a.PUT.9
//	a.DEL.8  --->
//	a.PUT.7
//	--             --
//	a.DEL.6  --->  a.DEL.6
//	a.PUT.5
//
// All of the rules described earlier still apply, but they are confined to
// operate within a snapshot stripe. Snapshots only affect compaction when the
// snapshot sequence number lies within the range of sequence numbers being
// compacted. In the above example, a snapshot at sequence number 10 or at
// sequence number 5 would not have any effect.
//
// 4. Range Deletions
//
// Range deletions provide the ability to delete all of the keys (and values)
// in a contiguous range. Range deletions are stored indexed by their start
// key. The end key of the range is stored in the value. In order to support
// lookup of the range deletions which overlap with a particular key, the range
// deletion tombstones need to be fragmented whenever they overlap. This
// fragmentation is performed by keyspan.Fragmenter. The fragments are then
// subject to the rules for snapshots. For example, consider the two range
// tombstones [a,e)#1 and [c,g)#2:
//
//	2:     c-------g
//	1: a-------e
//
// These tombstones will be fragmented into:
//
//	2:     c---e---g
//	1: a---c---e
//
// Do we output the fragment [c,e)#1? Since it is covered by [c-e]#2 the answer
// depends on whether it is in a new snapshot stripe.
//
// In addition to the fragmentation of range tombstones, compaction also needs
// to take the range tombstones into consideration when outputting normal
// keys. Just as with point deletions, a range deletion covering an entry can
// cause the entry to be elided.
//
// A note on the stability of keys and values.
//
// The stability guarantees of keys and values returned by the iterator tree
// that backs a compactionIter is nuanced and care must be taken when
// referencing any returned items.
//
// Keys and values returned by exported functions (i.e. First, Next, etc.) have
// lifetimes that fall into two categories:
//
// Lifetime valid for duration of compaction. Range deletion keys and values are
// stable for the duration of the compaction, due to way in which a
// compactionIter is typically constructed (i.e. via (*compaction).newInputIter,
// which wraps the iterator over the range deletion block in a noCloseIter,
// preventing the release of the backing memory until the compaction is
// finished).
//
// Lifetime limited to duration of sstable block liveness. Point keys (SET, DEL,
// etc.) and values must be cloned / copied following the return from the
// exported function, and before a subsequent call to Next advances the iterator
// and mutates the contents of the returned key and value.
