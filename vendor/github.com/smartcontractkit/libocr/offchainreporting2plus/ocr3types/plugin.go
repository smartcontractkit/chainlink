// A ReportingPlugin allows plugging custom logic into the OCR3 protocol. The
// OCR protocol handles cryptography, networking, ensuring that a sufficient
// number of nodes is in agreement about any report, transmitting the report to
// the contract, etc... The ReportingPlugin handles application-specific logic.
// To do so, the ReportingPlugin defines a number of callbacks that are called
// by the OCR protocol logic at certain points in the protocol's execution flow.
// The report generated by the ReportingPlugin must be in a format understood by
// contract that the reports are transmitted to.
//
// We assume that each correct node participating in the protocol instance will
// be running the same ReportingPlugin implementation. However, not all nodes
// may be correct; up to f nodes be faulty in arbitrary ways (aka byzantine
// faults). For example, faulty nodes could be down, have intermittent
// connectivity issues, send garbage messages, or be controlled by an adversary.
//
// For a protocol round where everything is working correctly, followers will
// call Observation, ValidateObservation, Outcome, and Reports. For each report,
// ShouldAcceptAttestedReport will be called as well. If
// ShouldAcceptAttestedReport returns true, ShouldTransmitAcceptedReport will be
// called. However, an ReportingPlugin must also correctly handle the case where
// faults occur.
//
// In particular, an ReportingPlugin must deal with cases where:
//
// - only a subset of the functions on the ReportingPlugin are invoked for a
// given round
//
// - an arbitrary number of seqnrs has been skipped between invocations of the
// ReportingPlugin
//
// - the observation returned by Observation is not included in the list of
// AttributedObservations passed to Report
//
// - a query or observation is malformed. (For defense in depth, it is also
// recommended that malformed outcomes are handled gracefully.)
//
// - instances of the ReportingPlugin run by different oracles have different
// call traces. E.g., the ReportingPlugin's Observation function may have been
// invoked on node A, but not on node B.
//
// All functions on an ReportingPlugin should be thread-safe.
//
// All functions that take a context as their first argument may still do cheap
// computations after the context expires, but should stop any blocking
// interactions with outside services (APIs, database, ...) and return as
// quickly as possible. (Rough rule of thumb: any such computation should not
// take longer than a few ms.) A blocking function may block execution of the
// entire protocol instance on its node!
//
// For a given OCR protocol instance, there can be many (consecutive) instances
// of an ReportingPlugin, e.g. due to software restarts. If you need
// ReportingPlugin state to survive across restarts, you should store it in the
// Outcome or persist it. An ReportingPlugin instance will only ever serve a
// single protocol instance. Outcomes and other state are are not preserved
// between protocol instances. A fresh protocol instance will start with a clean
// state. Carrying state between different protocol instances is up to the
// ReportingPlugin logic.
