// A MercuryPlugin allows plugging custom logic into the OCR protocol. The OCR
// protocol handles cryptography, networking, ensuring that a sufficient number
// of nodes is in agreement about any report, transmitting the report to another
// system, etc... The MercuryPlugin handles application-specific logic. To do
// so, the MercuryPlugin defines a number of callbacks that are called by the
// OCR protocol logic at certain points in the protocol's execution flow. The
// report generated by the MercuryPlugin must be in a format understood by
// contract that the reports are transmitted to.
//
// We assume that each correct node participating in the protocol instance will
// be running the same MercuryPlugin implementation. However, not all nodes may
// be correct; up to f nodes be faulty in arbitrary ways (aka byzantine faults).
// For example, faulty nodes could be down, have intermittent connectivity
// issues, send garbage messages, or be controlled by an adversary.
//
// For a protocol round where everything is working correctly, followers will
// call Observation and Report. If a sufficient number of followers agree on a
// report, ShouldAcceptAttestedReport will be called as well. If
// ShouldAcceptAttestedReport returns true, ShouldTransmitAcceptedReport will
// be called. However, a MercuryPlugin must also correctly handle the case where
// faults occur.
//
// In particular, a MercuryPlugin must deal with cases where:
//
// - only a subset of the functions on the MercuryPlugin are invoked for a given
// round
//
// - an arbitrary number of epochs and rounds has been skipped between
// invocations of the MercuryPlugin
//
// - the observation returned by Observation is not included in the list of
// AttributedObservations passed to Report
//
// - an observation is malformed. (For defense in depth, it is also strongly
// recommended that malformed reports are handled gracefully.)
//
// - instances of the MercuryPlugin run by different oracles have different call
// traces. E.g., the MercuryPlugin's Observation function may have been invoked
// on node A, but not on node B.
//
// All functions on a MercuryPlugin should be thread-safe.
//
// All functions that take a context as their first argument may still do cheap
// computations after the context expires, but should stop any blocking
// interactions with outside services (APIs, database, ...) and return as
// quickly as possible. (Rough rule of thumb: any such computation should not
// take longer than a few ms.) A blocking function may block execution of the
// entire protocol instance!
//
// For a given OCR protocol instance, there can be many (consecutive) instances
// of a MercuryPlugin, e.g. due to software restarts. If you need MercuryPlugin
// state to survive across restarts, you should persist it. A MercuryPlugin
// instance will only ever serve a single protocol instance. When we talk about
// "instance" below, we typically mean MercuryPlugin instances, not protocol
// instances.
