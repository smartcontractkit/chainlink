// A ReportingPlugin allows plugging custom logic into the OCR protocol. The OCR
// protocol handles cryptography, networking, ensuring that a sufficient number
// of nodes is in agreement about any report, transmitting the report to the
// contract, etc... The ReportingPlugin handles application-specific logic. To
// do so, the ReportingPlugin defines a number of callbacks that are called by
// the OCR protocol logic at certain points in the protocol's execution flow.
// The report generated by the ReportingPlugin must be in a format understood by
// contract that the reports are transmitted to.
//
// Roughly speaking, the protocol works as follows: A designated leader (fixed
// per epoch) broadcasts a request for observations containing an
// application-specific query to all followers. (Note the leader is also a
// follower of itself, i.e. one node acts as leader and all nodes act as
// followers.) Followers make signed observations and send them back to the
// leader. The leader collects the observations and broadcasts a report request
// containing the original query and the collected signed observations to all
// followers. At this stage, followers decide whether a report should be
// created. If followers decide not to create a report, the round ends here.
// Otherwise, followers construct a signed report (ultimately destined for the
// target contract) and send it to the leader. The leader collects the signed
// report(s) and sends out a final message containing a report together with a
// sufficient number of signatures. The followers echo the final message amongst
// each other prevent a malicious leader from selectively excluding particular
// nodes. Each follower independently decides whether it wishes to accept the
// final report for transmission. If it accepts it for transmission, the
// follower will wait for some time (according to a shared schedule) before
// attempting to transmit the report. After this time, the follower will check
// one last time whether to broadcast the transmit transaction before sending
// it. (Due to its brevity, this description skips over lots of details and edge
// cases. This is just to give a rough idea of the protocol flow.)
//
// We assume that each correct node participating in the protocol instance will
// be running the same ReportingPlugin implementation. However, not all nodes
// may be correct; up to f nodes be faulty in arbitrary ways (aka byzantine
// faults). For example, faulty nodes could be down, have intermittent
// connectivity issues, send garbage messages, or be controlled by an adversary.
//
// For a protocol round where everything is working correctly, the leader will
// start by invoking Query. Followers will call Observation and Report. If a
// sufficient number of followers agree on a report, ShouldAcceptFinalizedReport
// will be called as well. If ShouldAcceptFinalizedReport returns true,
// ShouldTransmitAcceptedReport will be called. However, a ReportingPlugin must
// also correctly handle the case where faults occur.
//
// In particular, a ReportingPlugin must deal with cases where:
//
// - only a subset of the functions on the ReportingPlugin are invoked for a
// given round
//
// - an arbitrary number of epochs and rounds has been skipped between
// invocations of the ReportingPlugin
//
// - the observation returned by Observation is not included in the list of
// AttributedObservations passed to Report
//
// - a query or observation is malformed. (For defense in depth, it is also
// strongly recommended that malformed reports are handled gracefully.)
//
// - instances of the ReportingPlugin run by different oracles have different
// call traces. E.g., the ReportingPlugin's Observation function may have been
// invoked on node A, but not on node B. Or Observation may have been invoked on
// A and B, but with different queries.
//
// All functions on a ReportingPlugin should be thread-safe.
//
// All functions that take a context as their first argument may still do cheap
// computations after the context expires, but should stop any blocking
// interactions with outside services (APIs, database, ...) and return as
// quickly as possible. (Rough rule of thumb: any such computation should not
// take longer than a few ms.) A blocking function may block execution of the
// entire protocol instance!
//
// For a given OCR2 protocol instance, there can be many (consecutive) instances
// of a ReportingPlugin, e.g. due to software restarts. If you need
// ReportingPlugin state to survive across restarts, you should persist it. A
// ReportingPlugin instance will only ever serve a single protocol instance.
// When we talk about "instance" below, we typically mean ReportingPlugin
// instances, not protocol instances.
