// Package keyring provides common key management API.
//
// # The Keyring interface
//
// The Keyring interface defines the methods that a type needs to implement to be used
// as key storage backend. This package provides a few implementations out-of-the-box.
//
// # NewInMemory
//
// The NewInMemory constructor returns an implementation backed by an in-memory, goroutine-safe
// map that has historically been used for testing purposes or on-the-fly key generation as the
// generated keys are discarded when the process terminates or the type instance is garbage
// collected.
//
// # New
//
// The New constructor returns an implementation backed by a keyring library
// (https://github.com/99designs/keyring), whose aim is to provide a common abstraction and uniform
// interface between secret stores available for Windows, macOS, and most GNU/Linux distributions
// as well as operating system-agnostic encrypted file-based backends.
//
// The backends:
//
//	os	The instance returned by this constructor uses the operating system's default
//		credentials store to handle keys storage operations securely. It should be noted
//		that the keyring may be kept unlocked for the whole duration of the user
//		session.
//	file	This backend more closely resembles the previous keyring storage used prior to
//		v0.38.1. It stores the keyring encrypted within the app's configuration directory.
//		This keyring will request a password each time it is accessed, which may occur
//		multiple times in a single command resulting in repeated password prompts.
//	kwallet	This backend uses KDE Wallet Manager as a credentials management application:
//		https://github.com/KDE/kwallet
//	pass	This backend uses the pass command line utility to store and retrieve keys:
//		https://www.passwordstore.org/
//	test	This backend stores keys insecurely to disk. It does not prompt for a password to
//		be unlocked and it should be used only for testing purposes.
//	memory	Same instance as returned by NewInMemory. This backend uses a transient storage. Keys
//		are discarded when the process terminates or the type instance is garbage collected.
