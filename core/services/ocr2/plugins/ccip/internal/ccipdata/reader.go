	// we might have logs waiting in OnRamp to be committed first. When outage takes days we still would
	// be able to bring back processing without replaying any logs from chain. You can read that param as

	// Restarting node clears the cache entirely and rebuilds it from scratch by fetching data from chain,
	// so we don't need to keep these logs for very long. All events relying on cache.NewLogpollerEventsBased should use this retention.
