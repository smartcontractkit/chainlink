// NonceSyncer manages the delicate task of syncing the local nonce with the
// chain nonce in case of divergence.
//
// On startup, we check each key for the nonce value on chain and compare
// it to our local value.
//
// Usually the on-chain nonce will be the same as (or lower than) the
// highest sequence in the DB, in which case we do nothing.
//
// If we are restoring from a backup however, or another wallet has used the
// account, the chain nonce might be higher than our local one. In this
// scenario, we must fastforward the local nonce to match the chain nonce.
//
// The problem with doing this is that now Chainlink does not have any
// ownership or control over potentially pending transactions with nonces
// between our local highest nonce and the chain nonce. If one of those
// transactions is pushed out of the mempool or re-org'd out of the chain,
// we run the risk of being stuck with a gap in the nonce sequence that
// will never be filled.
//
// The solution is to query the chain for our own transactions and take
// ownership of them by writing them to the database and letting the
// EthConfirmer handle them as it would any other transaction.
//
// This is not quite as straightforward as one might expect. We cannot
// query transactions from our account to infinite depth (geth does not
// support this). The best we can do is to query for all transactions sent
// within the past EVM.FinalityDepth blocks and find the ones sent by our
// address(es).
//
// This gives us re-org protection up to EVM.FinalityDepth deep in the
// worst case, which is in line with our other guarantees.
