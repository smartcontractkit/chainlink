# FinalityDepth is the number of blocks after which an ethereum transaction is considered "final". Note that the default is automatically set based on chain ID so it should not be necessary to change this under normal operation.
# BlocksConsideredFinal determines how deeply we look back to ensure that transactions are confirmed onto the longest chain
# There is not a large performance penalty to setting this relatively high (on the order of hundreds)
# It is practically limited by the number of heads we store in the database and should be less than this with a comfortable margin.
# If a transaction is mined in a block more than this many blocks ago, and is reorged out, we will NOT retransmit this transaction and undefined behaviour can occur including gaps in the nonce sequence that require manual intervention to fix.
# Therefore this number represents a number of blocks we consider large enough that no re-org this deep will ever feasibly happen.
#
# Special cases:
# `FinalityDepth`=0 would imply that transactions can be final even before they were mined into a block. This is not supported.
# `FinalityDepth`=1 implies that transactions are final after we see them in one block.

# - `Optimism2`/`L2Suggested` is a special mode only for use with Optimism and Metis blockchains. This mode will use the gas price suggested by the rpc endpoint via `eth_gasPrice`.
# - `Arbitrum` is a special mode only for use with Arbitrum blockchains. It uses the suggested gas price (up to `ETH_MAX_GAS_PRICE_WEI`, with `1000 gwei` default) as well as an estimated gas limit (up to `ETH_GAS_LIMIT_MAX`, with `1,000,000,000` default).
#
# Chainlink nodes decide what gas price to use using an `Estimator`. It ships with several simple and battle-hardened built-in estimators that should work well for almost all use-cases. Note that estimators will change their behaviour slightly depending on if you are in EIP-1559 mode or not.
#
# You can also use your own estimator for gas price by selecting the `FixedPrice` estimator and using the exposed API to set the price.
#
# An important point to note is that the Chainlink node does _not_ ship with built-in support for go-ethereum's `estimateGas` call. This is for several reasons, including security and reliability. We have found empirically that it is not generally safe to rely on the remote ETH node's idea of what gas price should be.

# EIP1559DynamicFees torces EIP-1559 transaction mode. Enabling EIP-1559 mode can help reduce gas costs on chains that support it. This is supported only on official Ethereum mainnet and testnets. It is not recommended to enable this setting on Polygon because the EIP-1559 fee market appears to be broken on all Polygon chains and EIP-1559 transactions are less likely to be included than legacy transactions.
#
# #### Technical details
#
# Chainlink nodes include experimental support for submitting transactions using type 0x2 (EIP-1559) envelope.
#
# EIP-1559 mode is enabled by default on the Ethereum Mainnet, but can be enabled on a per-chain basis or globally.
#
# This might help to save gas on spikes. Chainlink nodes should react faster on the upleg and avoid overpaying on the downleg. It might also be possible to set `EVM.GasEstimator.BlockHistory.BatchSize` to a smaller value such as 12 or even 6 because tip cap should be a more consistent indicator of inclusion time than total gas price. This would make Chainlink nodes more responsive and should reduce response time variance. Some experimentation is required to find optimum settings.
#
# Set with caution, if you set this on a chain that does not actually support EIP-1559 your node will be broken.
#
# In EIP-1559 mode, the total price for the transaction is the minimum of base fee + tip cap and fee cap. More information can be found on the [official EIP](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md).
#
# Chainlink's implementation of EIP-1559 works as follows:
#
# If you are using FixedPriceEstimator:
# - With gas bumping disabled, it will submit all transactions with `feecap=PriceMax` and `tipcap=GasTipCapDefault`
# - With gas bumping enabled, it will submit all transactions initially with `feecap=GasFeeCapDefault` and `tipcap=GasTipCapDefault`.
#
# If you are using BlockHistoryEstimator (default for most chains):
# - With gas bumping disabled, it will submit all transactions with `feecap=PriceMax` and `tipcap=<calculated using past blocks>`
# - With gas bumping enabled (default for most chains) it will submit all transactions initially with `feecap=current block base fee * (1.125 ^ N)` where N is configurable by setting `EVM.GasEstimator.BlockHistory.EIP1559FeeCapBufferBlocks` but defaults to `gas bump threshold+1` and `tipcap=<calculated using past blocks>`
#
# Bumping works as follows:
#
# - Increase tipcap by `max(tipcap * (1 + GasBumpPercent), tipcap + GasBumpWei)`
# - Increase feecap by `max(feecap * (1 + GasBumpPercent), feecap + GasBumpWei)`
#
# A quick note on terminology - Chainlink nodes use the same terms used internally by go-ethereum source code to describe various prices. This is not the same as the externally used terms. For reference:
#
# - Base Fee Per Gas = BaseFeePerGas
# - Max Fee Per Gas = FeeCap
# - Max Priority Fee Per Gas = TipCap
#
# In EIP-1559 mode, the following changes occur to how configuration works:
#
# - All new transactions will be sent as type 0x2 transactions specifying a TipCap and FeeCap. Be aware that existing pending legacy transactions will continue to be gas bumped in legacy mode.
# - `BlockHistoryEstimator` will apply its calculations (gas percentile etc) to the TipCap and this value will be used for new transactions (GasPrice will be ignored)
# - `FixedPriceEstimator` will use `GasTipCapDefault` instead of `GasPriceDefault` for the tip cap
# - `FixedPriceEstimator` will use `GasFeeCapDefault` instaed of `GasPriceDefault` for the fee cap
# - `PriceMin` is ignored for new transactions and `GasTipCapMinimum` is used instead (default 0)
# - `PriceMax` still represents that absolute upper limit that Chainlink will ever spend (total) on a single tx
# - `Keeper.GasTipCapBufferPercent` is ignored in EIP-1559 mode and `Keeper.GasTipCapBufferPercent` is used instead
EIP1559DynamicFees = false # Default
# FeeCapDefault controls the fixed initial fee cap, if EIP1559 mode is enabled and `FixedPrice` gas estimator is used.
