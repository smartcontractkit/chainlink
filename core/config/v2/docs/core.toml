# As a best practice, take regular database backups in case of accidental data loss. This best practice is especially important when you upgrade your Chainlink node to a new version. Chainlink nodes support automated database backups to make this process easier.

# NOTE: Dumps can cause high load and massive database latencies, which will negatively impact the normal functioning of the Chainlink node. For this reason, it is recommended to set a `URL` and point it to a read replica if you enable automatic backups.
[Database.Backup]
# Mode sets the type of automatic database backup, which can be one of _none_, `lite`, or `full`. If enabled, the Chainlink node will always dump a backup on every boot before running migrations. Additionally, it will automatically take database backups that overwrite the backup file for the given version at regular intervals if `Frequency` is set to a non-zero interval.
#
# _none_ - Disables backups.
# `lite` - Dumps small tables including configuration and keys that are essential for the node to function, which excludes historical data like job runs, transaction history, etc.
# `full` - Dumps the entire database.
#
# It will write to a file like `$ROOT/backup/cl_backup_<VERSION>.dump`. There is one backup dump file per version of the Chainlink node. If you upgrade the node, it will keep the backup taken right before the upgrade migration so you can restore to an older version if necessary.

# Ideally, you should use a container orchestration system like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to ensure that only one Chainlink node instance can ever use a specific Postgres database. However, some node operators do not have the technical capacity to do this. Common use cases run multiple Chainlink node instances in failover mode as recommended by our official documentation. The first instance takes a lock on the database and subsequent instances will wait trying to take this lock in case the first instance fails.
#
# - If your nodes or applications hold locks open for several hours or days, Postgres is unable to complete internal cleanup tasks. The Postgres maintainers explicitly discourage holding locks open for long periods of time.
#
# Because of the complications with advisory locks, Chainlink nodes with v2.0 and later only support `lease` locking mode. The `lease` locking mode works using the following process:
#
# - Node A creates one row in the database with the client ID and updates it once per second.
# - Node B spinlocks and checks periodically to see if the client ID is too old. If the client ID is not updated after a period of time, node B assumes that node A failed and takes over. Node B becomes the owner of the row and updates the client ID once per second.
# - If node A comes back, it attempts to take out a lease, realizes that the database has been leased to another process, and exits the entire application immediately.

#  - "error": An unexpected error occurred during the regular operation of a well-maintained node. Node operators might need to take action to remedy this error. Check these regularly to see if any of them require attention. Examples: Use of deprecated configuration options or incorrectly configured settings that cause a job to fail.
#  - "crit": A critical error occurred. The node might be unable to function. Node operators should take immediate action to fix these errors. Examples: The node could not boot because a network socket could not be opened or the database became inaccessible.
#  - "panic": An exceptional error occurred that could not be handled. If the node is unresponsive, node operators should try to restart their nodes and notify the Chainlink team of a potential bug.
