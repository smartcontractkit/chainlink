[Database]
# URL is the PostgreSQL URI to connect to your database. Chainlink nodes require Postgres versions >= 11. See
# [Running a Chainlink Node](https://docs.chain.link/docs/running-a-chainlink-node/#set-the-remote-database_url-config) for an example.
#
# Environment variable: `CL_DATABASE_URL`
URL = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable" # Example
# BackupURL is where the automatic database backup will pull from, rather than the main DATABASE_URL. It is recommended
# to set this value to a read replica if you have one to avoid excessive load on the main database.
#
# Environment variable: `CL_DATABASE_BACKUP_URL`
BackupURL = "postgresql://user:pass@read-replica.example.com:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable" # Example
