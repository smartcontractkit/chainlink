# Chainlink Core

This directory contains the majority of the code for the backend of Chainlink.

Outside of the code contained in this repo, some static assets are pulled in using
[packr](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr), in the sibling directory `packr/`.
For the backend, the solidity ABIs are used to generate types for interacting with
Ethereum contracts. Additionally, the static assets generated by compiling the
sibling directory `operator-ui/` are built by packr and included in the final
binary.

See the [root README](../README.md#install)
for instructions on how to build the full Chainlink node.

## Common Commands

**Install:**

By default `go install` will install this directory under the name `core`.
You can instead, build it, and place it in your path as `chainlink`:
```
go build -o $GOPATH/bin/chainlink .
```

**Test:**

```
# A higher parallel number can speed up tests at the expense of more RAM.
go test -p 1 ./...
```

The golang testsuite is almost entirely parallelizable, and so running the default
`go test ./...` will commonly peg your processor. Limit parallelization with the
`-p 2` or whatever best fits your computer: `go test -p 4 ./...`.
