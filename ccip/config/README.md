# Default Configurations

:warning: IMPORTANT :warning:

This directory contains configs that are specific to the CCIP build. Apply changes here only if related to the CCIP.


All config sets **inherit** from `fallback.toml` first and overwrite
fields as necessary. Do not create a new full configuration from
scratch.
