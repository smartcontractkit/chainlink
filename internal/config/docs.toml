# As a best practice, take regular database backups in case of accidental data loss. This best practice is especially important when you upgrade your Chainlink node to a new version. Chainlink nodes support automated database backups to make this process easier.

# NOTE: Dumps can cause high load and massive database latencies, which will negatively impact the normal functioning of the Chainlink node. For this reason, it is recommended to set a `URL` and point it to a read replica if you enable automatic backups.
[Database.Backup]
# Mode sets the type of automatic database backup, which can be one of _none_, `lite`, or `full`. If enabled, the Chainlink node will always dump a backup on every boot before running migrations. Additionally, it will automatically take database backups that overwrite the backup file for the given version at regular intervals if `Frequency` is set to a non-zero interval.
#
# _none_ - Disables backups.
# `lite` - Dumps small tables including configuration and keys that are essential for the node to function, which excludes historical data like job runs, transaction history, etc.
# `full` - Dumps the entire database.
#
# It will write to a file like `$ROOT/backup/cl_backup_<VERSION>.dump`. There is one backup dump file per version of the Chainlink node. If you upgrade the node, it will keep the backup taken right before the upgrade migration so you can restore to an older version if necessary.

# Ideally, you should use a container orchestration system like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to ensure that only one Chainlink node instance can ever use a specific Postgres database. However, some node operators do not have the technical capacity to do this. Common use cases run multiple Chainlink node instances in failover mode as recommended by our official documentation. The first instance takes a lock on the database and subsequent instances will wait trying to take this lock in case the first instance fails.
#
# - If your nodes or applications hold locks open for several hours or days, Postgres is unable to complete internal cleanup tasks. The Postgres maintainers explicitly discourage holding locks open for long periods of time.
#
# Because of the complications with advisory locks, Chainlink nodes with v2.0 and later only support `lease` locking mode. The `lease` locking mode works using the following process:
#
# - Node A creates one row in the database with the client ID and updates it once per second.
# - Node B spinlocks and checks periodically to see if the client ID is too old. If the client ID is not updated after a period of time, node B assumes that node A failed and takes over. Node B becomes the owner of the row and updates the client ID once per second.
# - If node A comes back, it attempts to take out a lease, realizes that the database has been leased to another process, and exits the entire application immediately.

# FinalityDepth is the number of blocks after which an ethereum transaction is considered "final". Note that the default is automatically set based on chain ID so it should not be necessary to change this under normal operation.
# BlocksConsideredFinal determines how deeply we look back to ensure that transactions are confirmed onto the longest chain
# There is not a large performance penalty to setting this relatively high (on the order of hundreds)
# It is practically limited by the number of heads we store in the database and should be less than this with a comfortable margin.
# If a transaction is mined in a block more than this many blocks ago, and is reorged out, we will NOT retransmit this transaction and undefined behaviour can occur including gaps in the nonce sequence that require manual intervention to fix.

#
# You can also use your own estimator for gas price by selecting the `FixedPrice` estimator and using the exposed API to set the price.
#
# An important point to note is that the Chainlink node does _not_ ship with built-in support for go-ethereum's `estimateGas` call. This is for several reasons, including security and reliability. We have found empirically that it is not generally safe to rely on the remote ETH node's idea of what gas price should be.

# EIP1559DynamicFees torces EIP-1559 transaction mode. Enabling EIP-1559 mode can help reduce gas costs on chains that support it. This is supported only on official Ethereum mainnet and testnets. It is not recommended to enable this setting on Polygon because the EIP-1559 fee market appears to be broken on all Polygon chains and EIP-1559 transactions are less likely to be included than legacy transactions.
#
# #### Technical details
#
# Chainlink nodes include experimental support for submitting transactions using type 0x2 (EIP-1559) envelope.
#
# EIP-1559 mode is enabled by default on the Ethereum Mainnet, but can be enabled on a per-chain basis or globally.
#
# This might help to save gas on spikes. Chainlink nodes should react faster on the upleg and avoid overpaying on the downleg. It might also be possible to set `EVM.GasEstimator.BlockHistory.BatchSize` to a smaller value such as 12 or even 6 because tip cap should be a more consistent indicator of inclusion time than total gas price. This would make Chainlink nodes more responsive and should reduce response time variance. Some experimentation is required to find optimum settings.
#
# Set with caution, if you set this on a chain that does not actually support EIP-1559 your node will be broken.
#
# In EIP-1559 mode, the total price for the transaction is the minimum of base fee + tip cap and fee cap. More information can be found on the [official EIP](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md).
#
# Chainlink's implementation of EIP-1559 works as follows:
#
# If you are using FixedPriceEstimator:
# - With gas bumping disabled, it will submit all transactions with `feecap=MaxGasPriceWei` and `tipcap=GasTipCapDefault`
# - With gas bumping enabled, it will submit all transactions initially with `feecap=GasFeeCapDefault` and `tipcap=GasTipCapDefault`.
#
# If you are using BlockHistoryEstimator (default for most chains):
# - With gas bumping disabled, it will submit all transactions with `feecap=MaxGasPriceWei` and `tipcap=<calculated using past blocks>`
# - With gas bumping enabled (default for most chains) it will submit all transactions initially with `feecap=current block base fee * (1.125 ^ N)` where N is configurable by setting `EVM.GasEstimator.BlockHistory.EIP1559FeeCapBufferBlocks` but defaults to `gas bump threshold+1` and `tipcap=<calculated using past blocks>`
#
# Bumping works as follows:
#
# - Increase tipcap by `max(tipcap * (1 + GasBumpPercent), tipcap + GasBumpWei)`
# - Increase feecap by `max(feecap * (1 + GasBumpPercent), feecap + GasBumpWei)`
#
# A quick note on terminology - Chainlink nodes use the same terms used internally by go-ethereum source code to describe various prices. This is not the same as the externally used terms. For reference:
#
# - Base Fee Per Gas = BaseFeePerGas
# - Max Fee Per Gas = FeeCap
# - Max Priority Fee Per Gas = TipCap
#
# In EIP-1559 mode, the following changes occur to how configuration works:
#
# - All new transactions will be sent as type 0x2 transactions specifying a TipCap and FeeCap. Be aware that existing pending legacy transactions will continue to be gas bumped in legacy mode.
# - `BlockHistoryEstimator` will apply its calculations (gas percentile etc) to the TipCap and this value will be used for new transactions (GasPrice will be ignored)
# - `FixedPriceEstimator` will use `GasTipCapDefault` instead of `GasPriceDefault` for the tip cap
# - `FixedPriceEstimator` will use `GasFeeCapDefault` instaed of `GasPriceDefault` for the fee cap
# - `PriceMinWei` is ignored for new transactions and `GasTipCapMinimum` is used instead (default 0)
# - `PriceMaxWei` still represents that absolute upper limit that Chainlink will ever spend (total) on a single tx
# - `Keeper.GasTipCapBufferPercent` is ignored in EIP-1559 mode and `Keeper.GasTipCapBufferPercent` is used instead
EIP1559DynamicFees = false # Default
# FeeCapDefault controls the fixed initial fee cap, if EIP1559 mode is enabled and `FixedPrice` gas estimator is used.
FeeCapDefault = '100 gwei' # Default
# TipCapDefault is the default gas tip to use when submitting transactions to the blockchain. Will be overridden by the built-in `BlockHistoryEstimator` if enabled, and might be increased if gas bumping is enabled.
