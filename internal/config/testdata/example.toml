# This example demonstrates some of the features:

# FieldName is a string with a default value. Every field **must** be documented with a comment that begins with the field name.
FieldName = 'foo' # Default

# This is a loose comment.
# Comments can span multiple lines.

# TableName holds settings that do something...
# #### Details
#
# We can include a long description here:
#  1. some
#  2. list
#  3. items
[TableName]
# Bar doesn't have a default value, so an example **must** be included.
Bar = 10 # Example
# **ADVANCED**
# TrickyField should only be used by advanced users, so it includes the special line `**ADVANCED**` to include a common warning tag.
TrickyField = true # Default
